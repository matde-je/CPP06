//static_cast<type> (expr) âˆ’ The static_cast operator performs 
//a nonpolymorphic cast. For example, it can be used to cast a
// base class pointer into a derived class pointer.
//with extensions: pointer or reference to a derived class is additionally
// allowed to be cast to pointer or reference to unambiguous base class 
//(and vice versa) even if the base class is inaccessible 
//(that is, this cast ignores the private inheritance specifier). 
//Same applies to casting pointer to member to pointer to member of unambiguous non-virtual base;
